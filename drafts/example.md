Our guest speaker is Dr Bill Peace. He will talk about how the STOP APP collects information on human trafficking, which is later analysed in the intelligence-led centre. Attached you can find his profile.

The [STOP APP](http://www.stopthetraffik.org/uk/page/the-stop-app) empowers every person with a smart phone in their hand and equips them to take action against human trafficking. It is the first of its kind in combining community empowerment, big data management and anti-trafficking expertise to disrupt, combat and prevent this global issue.

As always, the event is free, open to the general public, and will end with a small networking reception with our fellow OCRN members.

We would appreciate if you can confirm your attendance by replying to this email.

We look forward to seeing you there.
